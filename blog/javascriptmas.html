                                <h3 class="article-date">December 17, 2020</h3>

                                <p>Earlier this year, I had an epiphany about what I wanted to do with my career.</p>

                                <p>For half my life, I had believed <a class="within-article-link"
                                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a>
                                        was my calling. I had
                                        enrolled in one of only two
                                        bioinformatics undergraduate programs in the country, then pursued a PhD in
                                        bioinformatics and
                                        finally I’m a bioinformatician at a renowned cancer research center. Sounds
                                        pretty good, right?</p>

                                <p>Not exactly. What I was doing on day one of my job, I’m still doing seven years later
                                        (with a few
                                        small deviations, but generally a flat path). With my niche responsibilities and
                                        lack of growth
                                        opportunities, I had hit a standstill and didn’t know how to move forwards. I
                                        took on whatever new
                                        and exciting projects were available, and mentored numerous co-op students, but
                                        still I was feeling
                                        unsatisfied. The problem was, I wasn’t developing my skills as a programmer and
                                        programming was the
                                        part that I enjoyed the most.</p>

                                <p>One day, I was talking to a network contact about my situation. I asked her what she
                                        did exactly, and
                                        as she described the work, my eyes widened and my smile turned into a huge grin.
                                        Wait, I thought. I
                                        was having a lightbulb moment. From that moment on, I knew what I wanted to do
                                        with my career.
                                        Fast-forward ten months later, and I’ve learned all the basics of front-end
                                        development (HTML,
                                        CSS, Javascript, and React) and even launched a project / blog site on a domain
                                        that I am proud to
                                        call my own (you're looking at it)!</p>

                                <p>2020 has brought nothing but surprises - the best surprise for me was realizing that
                                        I had control
                                        over my future and that learning can be fun!! The <a class="within-article-link"

                                        for me,
                                        and I’m excited to share my solutions for the <a class="within-article-link"

                                                days of #Javascriptmas</a>. For each day of December until Christmas, I
                                        get to practice my Javascript skills with a unique challenge, and I also get to
                                        discover different
                                        ways of solving the same problem.</p>

                                <p>Merry Javascriptmas!</p>
